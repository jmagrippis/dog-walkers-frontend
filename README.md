# Dog Walkers

A simple frontend app for finding all available dog walkers in an area.

To run the app `git clone` and `cd` into the repository and run `npm install`.

`npm test` will, predictably, run the modest test suite and `npm start` will start the webpack dev server, allowing you to see the app in action at http://localhost:8080/
